# eTHENA: Whitelisting Proposal

> Proposal for whitelisting eTHENA token on Thena.fi DEX.

This is doc is written as an article that first introduces the protocol and then outlines the benefits to Thena.fi from whitelisting eTHENA for a Gauge.


# Introduction
eTHENA is a liquid wrapper for the locked veTHE (Thena's veNFT) which makes it possible to trade the benefits of  a veTHE position using a traditional A.M.M. such as Thena itself.

# Mechanism
## Summary
- Users can convert their veNFT into eTHENA.
- eTHENA can be staked to earn BNB.
- ieTHENA is a dedicated compounder for eTHENA.

## Minting eTHENA
Initially in the first week, each 1 THE inside a veNFT will be able to mint out 1 eTHENA (1:1 ratio).
### Minting-price Ratio & Rebases
As the epochs go by the rewards from rebasing will be added to the main veNFT of eTHENA protocol without minting any new eTHENA. This will cause the minting ratio to shift from 1:1 to 1:(1+R), R being the rebase factor.
> For example, if the rebase for 2nd epoch is 0.5%, then the mint ratio will increase to 1.005, which means it would take a veNFT with 1.005 THE inside it to mint 1 eTHENA token.
 
Due the fact that there are no negative rebases in veTHE system, this minting-price ratio of eTHENA will keep on increasing forever, and it will keep on appreciating against plain THE in a veNFT. 

## Usage of the veNFT
The main veNFT of the system will be simply used to maximize the returns from voting. Vote distribution will only consider the after-sale value (in BNB) of the earnable Bribes & Voter fees to decide its vote.

All the earnings from Voting such as Bribes & Trade-fee will be sold in their entirity to purchase BNB.

All 100% of the Votes will be used for this purpose and this purpose only. Even if we have a conflict of interests in the future, the votes will be allocated solely on the basis of maximum BNB returns per vote.

## Usage of the BNB from Voting yield
- 74.26% of the BNB will be distributed to eTHENA stakers.
- 13.37% of the BNB will be give to Thena.fi Voters as a Bribe to gather votes for the vAMM-eTHENA/WBNB pool.
- 13.37% of the BNB will be used to acquire Protocol-owned Liquidity.

## Generating PoL
Half of the 13.37% of BNB will buyback eTHENA from the market and be matched with the other half to create liquidity tokens.

When eTHENA is whitelisted by Thena.fi Core Team, these LP tokens will be staked into its Thena.fi gauge to earn THE. All of the THE earned from this staking will be given back to Thena Voters as Bribes to attract further votes for our core pool (eTHENA/WBNB).

## Performance Fees
Once the system matures enough and there is sufficient liquidity, a part of the BNB from the recurring 13.37% funding allocated for PoL building will be sent to our treasury as performance fee.
- There will be Zero Performance fee initially for atleast 2–4 months.
- Performance fee is capped at a max of 13.37% of BNB earnings.
- This fees can only be taken from the PoL allocations.

# ieTHENA
Interest-bearing eTHENA, generated by the Kompound Protocol.
## Kompound Protocol
Home to the Original Granaries & GRAIN tokens, the Kompound Protocol is a multi-chain yield compounder created by the Guru Network in 2021 on Fantom. 

Today its the 3rd biggest on Metis & the Kucoin chains and a leading platform on multiple smaller blockchains.

## ieTHENA: A Special GRAIN
GRAINs are receipt tokens of our compounder. Their redemption price increases continuously as the generated yield gets reinvested to purchase more base tokens for the depositors.

Our users will be able to deposit their eTHENA tokens at the Kompound Protocol on Binance SmartChain. This Granary will stake the eTHENA to earn BNB, and use that to procure more eTHENA from the DEX & compound it back.

## Dual-layer compounding
This would be a doubly-compounding experience for our users, with the first layer of compounding coming from the Rebases onto eTHENA and the second layer from the compounding of BNB back into more eTHENA.

### Why don't we compound all yield at once?
- **Thena maxis** - who want the highest yield per unit THE.
- **Real Yield enthusiasts** - who prefer earnings & profits paid out regularly in BNB.



# Benefits to Thena.fi by whitelisting eTHENA
There are quite a few things that Guru Network brings to the table:

## Permanent Bribes
The eTHENA protocol has a dedicated minimum of 13.37% of it's net yield for Bribing the stakeholders of Thena DEX - the veTHE holders.

With eTHENA whitelisted, Thena will gain a permanent briber who is guaranteed to bribe in each and every epoch, irrespective of the market conditions.

## eTHENA Volume = BNB paid to Thena's Voters
Since eTHENA's core pool is with WBNB, the trading volume that takes place will pay the voters with BNB & eTHENA. And this volume is guaranteed by the Kompound Protocol.

## 'Fair Tokenomics' offering infinite scalability
Unlike generic tokens, the supply of eTHENA is not controlled by anyone. It can scale as much as THE itself. There are no "team tokens" or "VC Shares" , and  eTHENA can be minted at will by any THE or veTHE holder, permissionlessly.

## Extending the options for veTHE
eTHENA opens us the conduit for making the Locked veTHE position liquid again. It also relieves the user from the burden of claiming multiple tokens from bribes & trader-fees and subsidises the gas costs by socializing it.

For new users, it offers a no-commitment exposure to the Thena Economy. eTHENA brings purely Real Yield with it, befitting the Solidly approach.

## More liquidity on the Thena books
eTHENA/BNB pool will bring in another liquidity pool to Thena which is guaranteed to generate consistent trade volume, thanks to the ieTHENA Granary.

## The Solidly Experience
Guru Network is the oldest protocol using Solidly. We were the creators of the first solidly gauge on the testnet after Andre & team, and have been quite active in its testing, continuously taking part in improving the Solidly codebase with pulls & its economic model throughout its life & birth. Our token ELITE on Fantom has been participating in the SolidlyWars right from the First Epoch last winter. Today we own nearly 2% of Solidly's circulating supply on Ethereum and have been actively suggesting code improvements to it. We are also the biggest non-partner protocol in it's governance race. We are more equitably involved with the Equalizer exchange, where we helped reshape many of  its facets. Our Solidly Extended Router has been used by multiple Solidly forks & Aggregators to make their ecosystems inclusive to exotic tokens. An alliance with Guru Network would greatly benefit Thena in the long run, as we are not here just for the yields, but for developing & mainting the actual Tech that futhers the Decentralization phenomenon.

## And, Beginning of the Thena Wars
We are the first protocol in the governance race of Thena.fi outside of the 19 partners. We believe the whitelisting of eTHENA at  Thena will encourage a lot more smaller and newer protocols to build unique products atop Thena and kickstart an era of collaborative building here.
