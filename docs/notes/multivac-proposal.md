Our goal is to enable widespread on-chain trading of MTV coin on its native network as this would foster independent developer &amp; protocols to build atop its EVM infrastructure and attract more new users to it.<br>It is further requested that the LP Tokens obtained as a receipt by the MultiVAC Treasury from provisioning this liquidity at the VAX shall <b>not</b> be re-invested into our subsidiary platform "Lite Farmlands" in order to protect our users from yield dilution.<br><br> We strongly believe that a deep liquidity would propel the adoption of MTV onto a broader demographic which prefers decentralized primitives over censorable centralized platforms. Guru Network has been operating multiple projects spanning over 35 clients &amp; tens of thousands of users since the last 3 years. We are confident that if granted this request, we will together channel in a sizeable influx of users to the MultiVAC Network.<br><br>I thank you on behalf of the Guru Network for all the support &amp; encouragement bestowed upon us.</div><div style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><br></div><div style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><br></div><div style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">Sam<br>Core Developer, Guru Network DAO<br><i>Discord: <a href="https://discord.com/invite/QpyfMarNrV" title="543#3017">543#3017</a></i><br></div><div style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><br></div><div style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><br></div><div style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><br></div>
