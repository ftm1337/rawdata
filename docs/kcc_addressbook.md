# KCC.Guru
## Brief History
Initially, kcc.guru started out as the game development wing of Guru Network.  
We created the Kucino Casino and developed many games (still do!).  

Later as Guru Network expanded, we started provoding niche utility tools and services for blockchain devs and users, most of them free for use as a public good, and a few paid & premium services with our B2B contracting.

As of recently, we've started offering Yield Compounding services via our Flagship product, the Kompound Protocol, which endorses immutability with a No-Admin model & extreme Capital Efficiency via JIT Routing & OTG psuedo-dex-aggregation.

Currently, our mission is to acquire governance rights at various major DeFi protocols and boostrap a self-sustainance based reward-share model, as envisioned in our token KUCINO.
